```
 1/2 cup butter

 1   cup boiling water

 1   cup flour

 4   eggs, unbeaten

 2   cups powdered sugar
```

Grease a baking sheet and preheat oven to 450 degrees.

Place butter in saucepan and pour boiling water on top. Heat on medium just until
butter has melted. Sift flour and add it all at once to the water/butter mixture.
Stir with a WOODEN spoon until it forms into a ball.

Remove from heat. Add eggs one at a time and stir until smooth.

Drop using a tablespoon, three inches apart. Bake approximately 15 minutes,
until well puffed and lightly browned. Reduce the heat to 300 degree and bake
for 30-40 minutes. Remove and cool.

Fill with desired filling.

Notes: The Wolfe favorite filling was chocolate pudding dusted lightly with
powdered sugar. The creme puffs are also delicious stuffed with chicken salad or
pot-pie filling.
