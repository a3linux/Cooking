```
 3      cups all-purpose flour

 1 1/2  teaspoons baking soda

 1/2    teaspoon baking powder

 1      teaspoon salt

 3      teaspoons ground cinnamon

 1/2    teaspoon fresh grated nutmeg

 1/2    cup Almond Milk

 1      cup vegetable oil

 2      teaspoons pure vanilla extract

 1      cup granulated sugar

 3/4    cup brown sugar

 2      cups shredded zucchini

```

Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Grease and flour an 8×4-inch or 9×5-inch loaf pan.  Set aside.

In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt and spices.  Set aside.

In a medium bowl, whisk together Almond Milk, vegetable oil, vanilla extract, and sugars.  Shred the zucchini using a grater and squeeze it over a strainer to release some of the liquid. Whisk thoroughly, then add the shredded zucchini and almonds.

Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and fold together with a spatula.  Make sure all of the flour is thoroughly incorporated into the batter.  Spoon batter into prepared pan and place in the oven.  Bake for about 1 hour, or until a skewer inserted into the center of the bread comes out clean.

Allow to cool in pan for 20 minutes before inverting onto a wire rack to cool completely.

Bread will last, well wrapped at room temperature, for up to 5 days.
