```
 1   polish keilbasa, sliced 1/8" thick

 1   large green pepper diced

 2   medium onions, diced

 2   garlic cloves, chopped fine

 2   pounds ground beef

 2   cups cooked white rice

 46  ounces tomato juice

 12  ounces tomato sauce

 30   cabbage leaves

 32 ounces drained sauerkraut

 1 teaspoon salt

 1 teaspoon pepper

   garlic salt to taste
```

In a large bowl - mix together hamburger, onion, garlic, green peppers and rice.
Add salt and pepper.

In the bottom of a large (really large!) casserole or roasting pan, put the
drained sauerkraut.

Bring large pot of water to boil. Cook cabbage leaves until tender, 3-4 minutes.

Take a handful of the meat mixture and roll it in tender leaves. Tuck under the
ends of the leaves to secure filling inside. Pace in the casserole dish. Repeat
until all meat mixture has been used up.

Pour tomato juice and sauce over all cabbage rolls. Sprinkle with garlic salt.

Bake at 350 degrees for 1.5 to 2 hours.
