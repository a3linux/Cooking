 Salad:

 1   medium cabbage (red or green)

 1/2 red onion

 1   carrot cut into small strips

 1   hot pepper diced
 ----------------------
 Dressing:

 1   cup rice or white wine vinegar

 2   cups water

 2   table spoons salt

 To Taste: Cumin, Pepper, Oregano, Thyme

```

Combine all dry and wet ingredients in large bowl.

Use a jar to lightly grind the veggies in the brine. About 5 minutes.

Place a clean plate on top of the vegetables, and weigh it down to fully submerge them under the brine. Let sit at room temperature for at least 3 days, or longer to your taste; the flavor will deepen and mellow over time. When itâ€™s to your liking, transfer to clean jars, making sure brine covers the vegetables, and store in the refrigerator. Can keep for weeks.
