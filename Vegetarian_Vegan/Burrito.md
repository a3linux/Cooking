Soak black beans over night.

Before you begin preparing veggies, add bulgar and quinoa to small bowel cover
with water. Let sit for 15 to 20 minutes then empty rinse.

Rinse black beans then add them to a pot with 6 cups of water. It will take about
45 minutes or until beans are tender. You may need to add extra water to prevent the
beans from sticky to the bottom of the pot. After about 30 minutes add the bulgar
and quinoa to the beans in the pot.

Dice jalapeno pepper, sweet potatoes, garlic, and sweet potatoes into small squares.

Shred carrots and zucchini into long strings

Add onions and sweet potato to a pan with a bit of oil. Let this cook for several
minutes then add garlic, jalapeno, carrot and zucchini. Once all the veggies cooked
and the onions start to brown remove heat and add spices. Set aside.

After the beans are cooked mix spiced veggies and mix.

Add this mixture to a tortilla.

Note: The mix will keep for about a week.
