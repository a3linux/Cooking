```
 1   cups nutritional yeast (to start)

 1   cups flour (to start)

 1   small bowl filled with soymilk (or water)

 1   block firm tofu

 Your own blend of secret spices (paprika, salt, pepper, dill, cumin, chili powder, garlic powder )

```

Remove firm tofu from package. Place inside a large bowl then place a heavy object
on the tofu. This will help squeeze out excess water. This will take a while, so
move on to the next step creating your batter.

For your batter you will need to prepare three bowels. One for nutritional yeast
and spices, one for with flour, and one for your soy milk. Start off using a cup
of nutritional yeast and flour and add more as need.

Next you will want take your tofu and cut into triangles shaped slivers about 1/8 thick.

Dip the tofu into the flour, flowed by the water, then into the nutritional yeast.

You do not need to deep fry the tofu after it has been battered. Just gently pan
fry until the batter becomes a golden color.

Note: You can replace the flour with rice flour or any flour of your choosing.
Same goes for the soy milk.
